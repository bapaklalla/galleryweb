# WebGallery — a free-ish gallery template

So yeah, this is a simple web gallery template.  
You can use it, edit it, break it, rebuild it — whatever.  
It’s basically free for everyone.

BUT.  
Please don’t use my personal SVG assets (logo, header, name stuff).  
They’re literally my identity, and you obviously don’t want *my* name on *your* gallery.  
Just replace them. It takes like two minutes.

## 🖼 Recommended Image Formats (so your site doesn’t load like a potato)

If you actually care about performance, use:

- **AVIF** — tiny files, great quality  
- **WebP** — safe fallback  
- **JPEG** — fine, I guess, but compress it  
- **PNG** — only if you really need transparency

Don’t upload giant PNGs unless you enjoy slow loading times and pain.

## ⚠️ About the current images (don’t freak out)

The images in this template right now are **placeholders**.  
Not my artwork. Not meant for final use.  
I grabbed them from Pinterest just to test the layout.

If you use this template, **replace everything with your own art** or something you’re actually allowed to use.  
Art communities can be… sensitive. Just saying.

(put your final structure here, or leave it blank, I won’t judge)

## 📄 License (kind of)

This project is basically open-source.  
HTML, CSS, JS — go wild.

Just don’t redistribute my personal SVG logo/header/name assets.  
They’re not yours.  
Make your own.
